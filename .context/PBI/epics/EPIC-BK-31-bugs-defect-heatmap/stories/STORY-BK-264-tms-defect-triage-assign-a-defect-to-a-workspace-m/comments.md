## Workload Forecast — Resolved (git-flow-master Step 4)

The Stage 1 plan forecast this change at ~2118 lines (High risk) and left `Chain strategy: pending`. Resolved via the git-flow-master chained-PR decision tree:

Chain strategy: feature-branch-chain

Decision trace: Q1=No (new domain logic — assignee column, two new RPCs, UI controls, activity-feed wiring — not a mechanical rename/format/codegen sweep) · Q2=No (total estimate ~2118 lines across 4 natural layers — schema/RPCs, API, UI, activity-feed wiring — averages ~530 lines/slice, still over the 400-line review budget per slice even split 4 ways, so it does not fit the stacked-to-main "2-4 slices each under 400" shape) · Q3=Yes (the new `assignee*user*id` column and the two `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs are shared scaffolding the API slice and UI slice both depend on; this alters a live, already-shipped table (`bugs`) with RLS-sensitive DEFINER functions, so the schema stays subject to review-driven revision until the whole chain lands — a partial merge to staging would commit that shared schema before downstream slices have proven it fits) → feature-branch-chain

Decided by: /git-flow-master §Chained-PR decision tree (branching-strategies.md)

### Branch plan

- Integration branch `feat/BK-264-defect-triage`, cut from `origin/staging` (still at migration 0052 — BK-209's chain has not merged yet, so 0053/0054 numbering holds).
- Slice 1 (DB): migration 0054 (`assignee*user*id` column + `bunkai*assign*bug` + `bunkai*transition*bug_status` RPCs + consistency-trigger backstop) + isolation tests → committed/PR'd into `feat/BK-264-defect-triage`.
- Slice 2 (API): assign route, status-transition route, list-response assignee/email resolution → PR into `feat/BK-264-defect-triage`.
- Slice 3 (UI): `BugAssignControl`, `BugsListView` status-action control → PR into `feat/BK-264-defect-triage`.
- Slice 4 (Activity feed wiring): 4 new activity actions (constants/labels + API response) → PR into `feat/BK-264-defect-triage`.
- Final PR: `feat/BK-264-defect-triage` → `staging`.

Gate cleared. Stage 2 implementation may proceed under this branch plan.

## Ready for QA

Merged to `staging` via [PR #114](https://github.com/upex-galaxy/upex-bunkai-tms/pull/114), branch `feat/BK-264-defect-triage`. Deployed and READY on staging (same deployment as BK-209, both merged same session): https://upex-bunkai-7ubksz9by-upexgalaxy-saiotest.vercel.app

This story was created mid-sprint as a prerequisite for BK-212 — no shift-left QA phase, left unassigned.
