***Design approach (live-first):**** No dedicated environments-management mockup exists. Master Design Plan §4.10 (Settings) is currently unbuilt (0%, no mockup), and there is no environments screen in the US to Screen map. Per the project's live-first rule (Critical Rule #15), this story is buildable against the improved live UI / design system. The CRUD UI lives in the ****project settings / project-config area*** (a project-scoped "Environments" section), reusing the frozen design tokens and the existing list/form patterns of the project shell. A dedicated mockup is NOT a hard blocker; the live UI is the fidelity source. When a Settings mockup is authored later, add an Environments section row to §8 and reconcile.
